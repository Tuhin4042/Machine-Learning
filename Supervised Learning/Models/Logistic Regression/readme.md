## What is Logistic Regression?  

**Logistic Regression** is a statistical method used to predict categorical outcomes based on input variables. Unlike linear regression, it predicts probabilities using a sigmoid (logistic) function, which ensures the output values are between 0 and

## Why Use Logistic Regression?  

Logistic Regression is simple yet powerful and interpretable for classification problems.  

- **Applications**:  
  - Email spam detection (spam vs. not spam).  
  - Medical diagnosis (disease vs. no disease).  
  - Customer churn prediction (churn vs. no churn).  

- **Advantages**:  
  - Easy to implement and interpret.  
  - Works well with linearly separable data.  
  - Outputs probabilities for better decision-making.  

- **Limitations**:  
  - Assumes a linear relationship between features and log-odds.  
  - May underperform on non-linear datasets.  
  - Sensitive to outliers and multicollinearity.

## Features  

- Binary and multi-class classification using Logistic Regression.  
- Data preprocessing techniques like normalization and encoding categorical variables.  
- Model evaluation using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.  
- Visualization of decision boundaries and performance metrics.
