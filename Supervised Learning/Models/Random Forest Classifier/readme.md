## What is Random Forest Classifier?  

The Random Forest Classifier is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. It improves accuracy and reduces overfitting by aggregating the predictions of individual trees, which are trained on different subsets of the data.  

Key characteristics of Random Forest:  
- Uses bagging (bootstrap aggregation) to build multiple decision trees.  
- Aggregates the output of trees through majority voting for classification tasks.  
- Handles large datasets with higher dimensionality effectively.

## Why Use Random Forest Classifier?  

Random Forest is widely used due to its robustness and effectiveness in a variety of domains.  

- **Applications**:  
  - Fraud detection.  
  - Disease diagnosis (e.g., cancer detection).  
  - Customer segmentation.  
  - Sentiment analysis.  

- **Advantages**:  
  - Handles both numerical and categorical data.  
  - Reduces overfitting compared to individual decision trees.  
  - Provides feature importance scores.  
  - Robust to noise and outliers.  

- **Limitations**:  
  - Can be computationally expensive for large datasets.  
  - May not perform well on datasets with very sparse features.
