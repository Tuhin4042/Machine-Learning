## What is K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)?  

K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is a non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm that makes predictions based on the similarity of a data point to its nearest neighbors in the feature space. It assigns a class to a data point by a majority vote of its nearest neighbors (for classification) or calculates an average (for regression).  

Key Concept:  
- KNN relies on distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan) to determine the "closeness" of data points.

## Why Use KNN?  

KNN is widely used because of its simplicity and versatility:  

- **Applications**:  
  - Pattern recognition (e.g., handwritten digit classification).  
  - Recommendation systems (e.g., movie recommendations).  
  - Medical diagnostics (e.g., disease classification).  
  - Customer segmentation.  

- **Advantages**:  
  - Easy to understand and implement.  
  - No need for training, making it computationally inexpensive during setup.  
  - Flexible to various types of data.  

- **Limitations**:  
  - Computationally expensive during predictions, especially with large datasets.  
  - Sensitive to noisy data and irrelevant features.  
  - Requires careful selection of `k` (the number of neighbors).

## How Does KNN Work?  

1. **Choose the value of `k`** (number of neighbors).  
2. **Calculate distances** between the query point and all points in the dataset using a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski).  
3. **Select the `k` nearest neighbors** based on the calculated distances.  
4. **Make a prediction**:  
   - **For classification**: Assign the class with the majority vote among the neighbors.  
   - **For regression**: Calculate the average of the neighbors' values.
