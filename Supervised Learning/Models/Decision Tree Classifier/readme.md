## What is a Decision Tree Classifier?

A Decision Tree is a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, each branch represents the outcome of a decision, and each leaf node represents a class label (for classification) or a value (for regression).

Key Concepts:
- **Nodes**: Represent decisions or results.
- **Branches**: Represent possible outcomes of a decision.
- **Leaves**: Represent final predictions or classifications.

The algorithm selects features based on metrics like:
- **Gini Index**
- **Entropy (Information Gain)**
- **Reduction in Variance**

## Why Use a Decision Tree Classifier?

Decision Tree Classifiers are popular because:
- **Intuitive**: Easy to understand and interpret.
- **Versatile**: Handles both numerical and categorical data.
- **Non-linear relationships**: Captures complex decision boundaries.
- **Feature Importance**: Identifies the most important features in the dataset.

## Applications

Decision Trees are used in various domains, such as:
- **Healthcare**: Diagnosing diseases based on symptoms.
- **Finance**: Credit risk assessment and loan approval.
- **Marketing**: Customer segmentation and targeted advertising.
- **Gaming**: Decision-making in AI-driven gameplay.
