## What is a Model in Machine Learning?  
A **model** in machine learning is a mathematical representation of a real-world process that is trained to make predictions or decisions based on input data. It represents the relationship between inputs (features) and outputs (target variables) derived from data. The model learns this relationship by identifying patterns in the data during training.  

## Why Is a Model Used?  
Machine learning models are used to address diverse challenges, such as:  
1. **Prediction**: Forecast future outcomes using historical data (e.g., predicting house prices, stock trends).  
2. **Classification**: Categorize data into predefined groups (e.g., spam detection, medical diagnosis).  
3. **Automation**: Streamline tasks and processes (e.g., recommendation systems, fraud detection).  
4. **Decision-Making**: Facilitate data-driven decisions (e.g., loan approval, risk assessment).  
5. **Optimization**: Discover optimal solutions for complex problems (e.g., supply chain management, route optimization).  

## Types of Supervised Learning Models  

- **Use Cases**: Classification and regression tasks.  
- **Examples**:  
  - **Linear Regression**: Predicting continuous values (e.g., sales prediction).  
  - **Logistic Regression**: Binary classification (e.g., spam vs. not spam).  
  - **Decision Trees**: Decision-based predictions (e.g., diagnosing diseases).  
  - **Random Forests**: Ensemble method for improved accuracy (e.g., fraud detection).  
  - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Effective for classification tasks (e.g., image recognition).
