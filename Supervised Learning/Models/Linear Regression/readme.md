## What is Linear Regression?  
Linear Regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). It assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and the target variable, making predictions by fitting a straight line to the data.

## Why Use Linear Regression?  
Linear Regression is widely used because of its simplicity and interpretability.  
- **Applications**:  
  - Predicting sales, housing prices, or stock trends.  
  - Understanding relationships between variables.  
  - Evaluating feature importance.  

- **Advantages**:  
  - Simple to implement and interpret.  
  - Requires minimal computational resources.  
  - Works well with linearly separable data.  

- **Limitations**:  
  - Assumes a linear relationship.  
  - Sensitive to outliers.  
  - May underperform on complex datasets with non-linear patterns.

## Features  

- Implementation of Simple and Multiple Linear Regression.  
- Data preprocessing techniques like feature scaling and handling missing values.  
- Model evaluation using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (\( R^2 \)).  
- Visualizations for data exploration and regression line fitting.
