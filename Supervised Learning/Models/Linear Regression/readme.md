## What is Linear Regression?  
Linear Regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). It assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and the target variable, making predictions by fitting a straight line to the data.  

The general form of the equation is:  
\[ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \dots + \beta_nx_n + \epsilon \]  
Where:  
- \( y \) is the predicted value.  
- \( \beta_0 \) is the intercept.  
- \( \beta_1, \beta_2, \dots, \beta_n \) are the coefficients.  
- \( x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \) are the features.  
- \( \epsilon \) is the error term.

## Why Use Linear Regression?  
Linear Regression is widely used because of its simplicity and interpretability.  
- **Applications**:  
  - Predicting sales, housing prices, or stock trends.  
  - Understanding relationships between variables.  
  - Evaluating feature importance.  

- **Advantages**:  
  - Simple to implement and interpret.  
  - Requires minimal computational resources.  
  - Works well with linearly separable data.  

- **Limitations**:  
  - Assumes a linear relationship.  
  - Sensitive to outliers.  
  - May underperform on complex datasets with non-linear patterns.
