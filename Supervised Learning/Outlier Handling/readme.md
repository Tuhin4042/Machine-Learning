# Outlier Handling 
Outlier handling refers to the process of identifying, managing, and possibly removing outliers from a dataset to improve the performance and accuracy of models or analyses. Outliers are data points that significantly deviate from other observations in the dataset and can arise due to various reasons such as measurement errors, variability in the data.
# Some of its key features:

- ### Data Manipulation
- ### Data Cleaning
- ### Data Transformation
- ### Data Structures
- ### Data Input/Output

# Why Pandas is assential for Machine Learning?
Pandas is essential for machine learning because it plays a critical role in the early stages of the machine learning workflow, particularly in data preparation and preprocessing. Machine learning models rely on clean, structured, and well-organized data, and Pandas provides the tools necessary to achieve that
