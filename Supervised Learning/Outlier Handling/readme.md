# Outlier Handling

Outlier handling refers to the process of identifying, managing, and possibly removing outliers from a dataset to improve the performance and accuracy of models or analyses. Outliers are data points that significantly deviate from other observations in the dataset and can arise due to various reasons, such as measurement errors or natural variability in the data.

## Methods for Handling Outliers

- **IQR Method**: Uses the interquartile range to identify outliers that fall below or above a certain range.
- **Standard Deviation Method**: Considers values that lie several standard deviations away from the mean as outliers.
- **Z-Score Method**: Identifies outliers based on the z-score, which measures how many standard deviations a point is from the mean.

## Why Are Outliers Important?

- **Data Errors**: Outliers can sometimes indicate errors in data collection or entry. Identifying these improves data quality.
- **Model Influence**: Outliers can impact statistical measures like the mean and standard deviation, significantly influencing models sensitive to extreme values, such as linear regression.
- **Insight into Variability**: Outliers may represent important variability in the data, providing insights into underlying processes or trends.

## When to Use Outlier Handling?

- **Before Data Modeling**: Ensures the dataset is clean, resulting in more accurate model training.
- **When Data Quality Issues Are Suspected**: Helps identify potential inaccuracies in the data.
- **When Modeling Robustness Is Needed**: Reduces the risk of model sensitivity to extreme values, enhancing model robustness.
