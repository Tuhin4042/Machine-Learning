# Outlier Handling 
Outlier handling refers to the process of identifying, managing, and possibly removing outliers from a dataset to improve the performance and accuracy of models or analyses. Outliers are data points that significantly deviate from other observations in the dataset and can arise due to various reasons such as measurement errors, variability in the data.

# There are several methods for handling outliers, including:

- ### IQR Method
- ### Standard Deviation Method
- ### Z-Score Method

# Why Outliers Are Important?

- ### Data Errors
  Sometimes, outliers are the result of errors in data collection or entry. Identifying these can help improve data quality.
- ### Model Influence
  Outliers can have a significant impact on statistical measures like mean and standard deviation, and they can heavily influence models that are sensitive to extreme values, such as linear 
  regression.
- ### Insight into Variability
  Outliers may represent high variability in the data and could be valuable in understanding underlying processes or trends.
