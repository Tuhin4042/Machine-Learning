# Hyperparameter Tuning  

Hyperparameter tuning refers to the process of selecting the best configuration of hyperparameters for a machine learning model to optimize its performance on a given dataset. Hyperparameters are parameters set before the training process begins, such as learning rate, batch size, number of layers in a neural network, or the regularization factor. Unlike model parameters, hyperparameters are not learned during training and must be manually set or optimized. 

## Why Hyperparameter Tuning is Important  
- **Improves Model Accuracy**: By selecting the best hyperparameters, the model performs better on unseen data.  
- **Prevents Overfitting and Underfitting**: Tuning helps balance model complexity to generalize well.  
- **Optimizes Resources**: Efficient tuning reduces computation time and resources during training.

## Types of Hyperparameter Tuning and When to Use Them  

### 1. **Grid Search**  
**Use When**:  
- You have a small, well-defined search space.  
- Computational resources are not a constraint.  
- Exhaustive search for the best parameters is essential for your problem.  

**Example**: Tuning `C` and `gamma` for an SVM on a small dataset.

### 2. **Random Search**  
**Use When**:  
- The search space is large or continuous.  
- You want faster results compared to Grid Search.  
- A good-enough solution is acceptable without testing every combination.  

**Example**: Tuning hyperparameters for a deep learning model where the parameter space is vast.

### 3. **Bayesian Optimization**  
**Use When**:  
- You want to balance speed and accuracy in finding the best hyperparameters.  
- The tuning process needs to intelligently prioritize promising hyperparameters.  
- Computational cost for evaluating each configuration is high.  

**Example**: Optimizing hyperparameters for expensive-to-train models like XGBoost or deep neural networks.
