# Hyperparameter Tuning  

Hyperparameter tuning refers to the process of selecting the best configuration of hyperparameters for a machine learning model to optimize its performance on a given dataset. Hyperparameters are parameters set before the training process begins, such as learning rate, batch size, number of layers in a neural network, or the regularization factor. Unlike model parameters, hyperparameters are not learned during training and must be manually set or optimized. 

## Why Hyperparameter Tuning is Important  
- **Improves Model Accuracy**: By selecting the best hyperparameters, the model performs better on unseen data.  
- **Prevents Overfitting and Underfitting**: Tuning helps balance model complexity to generalize well.  
- **Optimizes Resources**: Efficient tuning reduces computation time and resources during training.

## Types of Hyperparameter Tuning  
### 1. **Grid Search**  
A systematic, exhaustive search over a predefined hyperparameter space. Each combination is evaluated, making it computationally expensive for large spaces.  

### 2. **Random Search**  
Randomly samples hyperparameters within the search space. It is faster than Grid Search and often finds good solutions.  

### 3. **Bayesian Optimization**  
Uses probabilistic models to predict performance and select hyperparameters intelligently, balancing exploration and exploitation.  

### 4. **Gradient-Based Optimization**  
Optimizes hyperparameters by calculating gradients, typically used in deep learning frameworks.
