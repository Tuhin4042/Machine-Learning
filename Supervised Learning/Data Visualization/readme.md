# What is Data Visualization?

**Data visualization** is the graphical representation of data and information using visual elements like charts, graphs, maps, and diagrams. Its purpose is to make complex data more accessible, understandable, and usable by uncovering patterns, trends, and outliers. Visualizations help in quickly grasping insights and making data-driven decisions.

## Common Types of Data Visualizations

- **Bar Chart**: Displays data with rectangular bars, useful for comparing categories.
- **Line Chart**: Shows trends over time with a continuous line connecting data points.
- **Pie Chart**: Represents parts of a whole as slices of a circle.
- **Scatter Plot**: Plots data points on a Cartesian coordinate system to identify relationships between variables.
- **Heatmap**: Uses color intensity to show data values across two dimensions.
- **Box Plot**: Displays data distribution based on five-number summary (min, Q1, median, Q3, max).
- **Histogram**: Represents data distribution across continuous intervals.
