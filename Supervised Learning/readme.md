# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset. In this approach, each data point consists of an input (features) and a corresponding output (label or target). The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs so that it can predict the label for unseen or new data.

## Key Concepts in Supervised Learning

- **Training Data**: The labeled data used to train the model.
- **Features (Input)**: The input variables or attributes used by the model to make predictions.
- **Labels (Output)**: The target values or outcomes associated with each data point in the training set.
- **Training Process**: The process by which the model learns to associate inputs with outputs.
- **Test Data**: A separate dataset used to evaluate the model's performance on new, unseen data.

## Types of Supervised Learning

- **Classification**: Predicting categorical labels, such as spam or not spam.
- **Regression**: Predicting continuous values, like house prices or temperature.

## Common Algorithms in Supervised Learning

- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**
- **Gradient Boosting**
