# What is Supervised Learning?
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset. In this approach, each data point consists of an input (features) and a corresponding output (label or target). The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs so that it can predict the label for unseen or new data.

## Key Concepts in Supervised Learning:
- ### Training Data
