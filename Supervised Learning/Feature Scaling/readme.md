# Feature Scaling

**Feature scaling** is the process of transforming the features (variables) in your dataset so that they have a similar range or distribution. This prevents any single feature from disproportionately influencing the model due to its magnitude, especially when feature scales vary significantly.

## Why Feature Scaling is Important

- **Improved Model Performance**: 
  Algorithms that compute distances (like k-NN, SVM, or logistic regression) or rely on gradient descent (e.g., neural networks) can be affected by the scale of features. If one feature has a much larger range than others, it may dominate the learning process.

- **Faster Convergence**:
  In models such as neural networks or linear regression, large feature values can result in larger gradients, potentially causing the model to overshoot the optimal solution and slowing convergence during training.

- **Equal Treatment of Features**:
  Scaling ensures that each feature contributes equally to the model, allowing algorithms to make fair comparisons.

## Common Methods of Feature Scaling

- **Min-Max Scaling (Normalization)**: Scales features to a fixed range, typically [0, 1].
- **Standardization (Z-score Normalization)**: Centers features around the mean with unit variance, scaling to a standard normal distribution.
