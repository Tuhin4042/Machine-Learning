# Feature scaling 
  Feature scaling is the process of transforming the features (variables) in your dataset so that they have a similar range or distribution. It ensures that no single feature disproportionately 
  influences the model due to its magnitude, especially when features vary significantly in scale.

## Why Feature Scaling is Important:

- ### Improved Model Performance:
 Algorithms that compute distances (like k-NN, SVM, or logistic regression) or those that rely on gradient descent (e.g., neural networks) can be heavily influenced by the scale of the features. If one feature has a much larger range than others, it can dominate the learning process.
- ### Faster Convergence:
  In models like neural networks or linear regression, large feature values can result in larger gradients, which may cause the model to overshoot the optimal solution, slowing down convergence during training.
- ### Equal Treatment of Features:
  Scaling ensures that each feature contributes equally to the model, allowing algorithms to make fair comparisons.

## Common Methods of Feature Scaling:

- ### Min-Max Scaling (Normalization)
- ### Standardization (Z-score Normalization)
