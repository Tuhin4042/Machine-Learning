# Feature Importance
  Feature importance is the technique of assigning a score to input features based on how useful they are in predicting a target variable. This helps in identifying which features have the 
  greatest impact on the model's performance, allowing for more efficient models and better understanding of the underlying relationships in the data.

## Some common methods for determining feature importance:

- ### Tree-based methods
- ### Coefficient-based methods(Regression)
- ### SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
