# Why We Use Machine Learning Models?

Machine Learning (ML) models enable systems to learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed. These models are widely used because of their ability to:

- **Automate Decision-Making**: ML models can automate complex and repetitive tasks, increasing efficiency.
- **Discover Insights**: They uncover hidden patterns and correlations within data.
- **Predict Future Trends**: ML models predict outcomes based on historical data, helping in proactive decision-making.
- **Adapt and Improve**: With continuous learning, these models improve their accuracy over time.
- **Handle Complex Problems**: ML is ideal for solving non-linear, high-dimensional, or otherwise complex problems.

## Types of Supervised Learning Models

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data (input-output pairs) to predict outcomes for new, unseen data. The common types of supervised models are:

### 1. **Regression Models**
   Used when the target variable is continuous. Examples include:
   - **Linear Regression**: Models a linear relationship between input variables and the target.
   - **Polynomial Regression**: Captures non-linear relationships by extending linear regression with polynomial terms.

### 2. **Classification Models**
   Used when the target variable is categorical. Examples include:
   - **Logistic Regression**: Predicts binary outcomes (e.g., yes/no).
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Classifies data points based on the majority class of their nearest neighbors.
   - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Finds the optimal boundary that separates classes in high-dimensional spaces.
   - **Decision Trees**: Uses a tree-like structure to make decisions based on feature values.
   - **Random Forests**: Combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
