# Decoding in Machine Learning

**Decoding**: is a fundamental process in machine learning that interprets encoded or abstract data representations and converts them into meaningful outputs. This repository is dedicated to exploring how decoding is applied in various machine learning algorithms and real-world applications, making abstract models understandable and actionable.
