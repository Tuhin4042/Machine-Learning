# What is Numpy? 
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library primarily used for numerical computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.
# Some of its key features:

- ### ndarray (n-dimensional array)
- ### Mathematical Functions
- ### Linear Algebra
- ### Random Number Generation
- ### Broadcasting
