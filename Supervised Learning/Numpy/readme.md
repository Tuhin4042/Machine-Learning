# What is NumPy?

**NumPy** (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library primarily used for numerical computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

## Key Features of NumPy

- **ndarray (n-dimensional array)**: Provides a fast, flexible, and efficient array object to store multi-dimensional data.
- **Mathematical Functions**: Includes a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on arrays.
- **Linear Algebra**: Supports linear algebra operations, such as matrix multiplication, decomposition, and more.
- **Random Number Generation**: Enables the creation of arrays filled with random numbers for simulation and testing.
- **Broadcasting**: Allows operations on arrays of different shapes, facilitating efficient computation without requiring explicit looping.
