# Machine-Learning
Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following hard-coded instructions, ML systems are designed to identify patterns and make inferences based on data.

## There are three main types of machine learning:

### Supervised Learning:  
  The model is trained on labeled data (where the correct output is known), and it learns to map inputs to outputs (e.g., predicting house prices).

### Unsupervised Learning: 
  The model is given data without labels and must find hidden patterns or groupings (e.g., customer segmentation).

### Reinforcement Learning: 
  The model learns by interacting with an environment, receiving feedback based on actions taken, and aiming to maximize a reward over time (e.g., game playing or robotics).
