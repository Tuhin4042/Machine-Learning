# Machine-Learning
Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following hard-coded instructions, ML systems are designed to identify patterns and make inferences based on data.

### There are three main types of machine learning:


#### Supervised Learning:  
      The model is trained on labeled data (where the correct output is known), and it learns to map inputs to outputs (e.g., predicting house prices).

#### Unsupervised Learning: 
      The model is given data without labels and must find hidden patterns or groupings (e.g., customer segmentation).

#### Reinforcement Learning: 
      The model learns by interacting with an environment, receiving feedback based on actions taken, and aiming to maximize a reward over time (e.g., game playing or robotics).
